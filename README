Developers:
* Install the latest Erlang
* Start the Erlang shell
* In the shell:
  * cd("checkout directory/src").
  * c(build).
  * build:all().
  * cd("../ebin").
  * application:start(gs_app).
  * application:stop(gs_app).
  

This is probably years from being ready for team development

Players:
Ha!

Design Goals/Decisions:
* Player can own multiple starships, but pilots one at a time
* Player pilots in real-time using text commands for viewing surroundings and driving (google: Basic Mech Instruction)
* Player can buy and sell cargo, fight NPC ships, fight player ships, complete missions, craft, explore, build, design ship fittings
* Some kind of randomized instance maps for players/teams to explore
* Single systems of planets/roids/bases connected by jump gates
* Systems are a 2d plane for easy navigation and text display
* Long and short range scanning/probing
* Electronic Warfare
* Player skills affecting combat rolls
* Fleet/Squad play
