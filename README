Design Goals/Decisions:
* Player can own multiple starships, but pilots one at a time
* Player pilots in real-time using text commands for viewing surroundings and driving (google: Basic Mech Instruction)
* Player can buy and sell cargo, fight NPC ships, fight player ships, complete missions, craft, explore, build, design ship layouts
* Some kind of randomized instance maps for players/teams to explore
* Single systems of planets/roids/bases connected by jump gates
* Systems are a 2d plane for easy navigation and text display
